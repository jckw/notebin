# üìù Notebin
A simple, anonymous textbin app!

### Idea
When the app is launched, and the first text-note is written, a unique code is generated to access the "folder" which stores all of the text-notes created.

The folder can be viewed later by entering the unique code generated when it was first created.

Text-notes can be added or edited whenever a folder is viewed, but cannot be deleted.
